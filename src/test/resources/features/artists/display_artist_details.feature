Feature: Display artist details
  In order to find more films that I might like
  As a viewer
  I want to see all of the films a particular artist has worked on, either as an actor or as a director

  Scenario: Display an artist's filmography

      | The Cable Guy       | Ben Stiller  | Jim Carrey                               |
